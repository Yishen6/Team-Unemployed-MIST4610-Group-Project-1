## Problem Description: 

In order to provide the most efficient and organized method of patient intakes, we created a database showing the relationships between the various entities in a hospital environment. From taking in an appointment to seeing the actual patient, we strive to display how the hospital operates beyond what the patient experiences. To do this, we plan on using datamodels to show how the hospital staff work together, how billing and insurance relates to the patient and even the correlations between prescribed medication to the patient. To ensure efficiency and provide quality services, we will use queries on the data we collected to provide insight on how to improve the hospital's operations.
